//Section Objective: It should have a way to display todos.

//Currently, we're working from the console
//For now, will print data using console.log
//You can print items to console.log if you enclose in ()
//When printing contents of a variable, don't use quotes

var todos = ['item 1', 'item 2', 'item 3'];
console.log(todos);
//we want the text "My Todos" to print before list of todos
console.log('My Todos:', todos);
//Expected output: "My Todos:" ["item 1", "item 2", "item 3"]
